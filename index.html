          <div>Division of Society</div>
          <div>The French society was divided into 3 estates or orders. Too much discrimination existed between them.</div>

          <div><h3>First Estate/Clergy</h3></div>
          <div><p>Although the members of church owned large amounts of land, yet they were privileged and were exempted from paying tax to the government. Rather the church levied the tax on the agricultural produce called as tithes.</p></div>

          <div><h3>Second Estate/Nobility</h3></div>
          <div><p>The nobles also held too much of landed property, and apart from that, they held high posts in army and administration, yet they were privileged by birth and were exempted from paying tax. They extracted feudal dues from the peasants.</p></div>
        </div></li>
      <div><h3>High Class of Third Estate</h3></div>
      <div><p>This class comprised of traders, merchants, officials, lawyers and as it was an intellectual class, they initiated the revolution because of the discrimination that existed in the society.</p></div>
      <div><h3>Landless peasants of Third Estate</h3></div>
      <div><p>This class was the worst sufferer as the entire burden of taxation fell on them. Apart from paying a direct tax to the state called taille, they also payed tax to the first and second estates.</p></div>
