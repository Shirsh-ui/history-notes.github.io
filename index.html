          <div>High Class of Third Estate</div>
          <div>This class comprised of traders, merchants, officials, lawyers and as it was an intellectual class, they initiated the revolution because of the discrimination that existed in the society.</div>

        <point-list>
          <div>Landless peasants of Third Estate</div>
          <div>This class was the worst sufferer as the entire burden of taxation fell on them. Apart from paying a direct tax to the state called taille, they also payed tax to the first and second estates.</div>
